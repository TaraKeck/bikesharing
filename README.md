# Bike Sharing Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
In order to convince investors that bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business, I have created an analysis of data conversion and visualizations to demonstrate.  The following steps and tasks were taken:

- Use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype.  
- Created a set of visualizations to:
  - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
The visualizations created resulted in the following line graphs and heat maps:

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders:
