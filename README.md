# Bike Sharing Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
In order to convince investors that bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business, I have created an analysis of data conversion and visualizations to demonstrate.  The following steps and tasks were taken:

- Use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype.  
- Created a set of visualizations to:
  - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
Used Pandaas to change the "tripduration" column from an integet to a datetime datatype, here is an image of this update:

The visualizations created resulted in the following line graphs and heat maps:

## Summary

After reviewing all data and the line charts as well as heat maps, it is highly recommeneded to expand the market into Des Moines for bike-sharing. The data was reviewed with the NYC Citibike Data.   The total number of riders that data was captured was:  2,344,224 riders.  In the total number of riders it was broken down by gender to get a better understanding of the demographic.   Bikesharing is a major source of transportation for commmuters since most data shows that Male/Female riders utlisize the service Monday through Friday during commuter peak hours (8am-9am, 5pm-6pm).

I would suggest to perform additional analysis to ensure that it's feasable to expand as there may be overhead needed in order to operate the market.  Currently there is a total trip ride of 5 minutes, I would recommend data on repairs to seee how much wear and tear on the bikes and repair costs would be crucial to review.  This would be beneficial in understanding operations side of the business.

From a marketing standpoint, I would suggest to do a deeper dive into the age ranges of the riders.    It would be beneficial to understand if the riders are high school, college students, or professionals.  There may be opportunities to market in areas that have a lot of potential since there may not be a lot of businesses in the Des Moines area.
